> # The Role of the Inventory System in Orders:
The Inventory System is mainly responsible for creating internal orders (SOs, POs, and MOs) that manage the flow of goods in and out of the business.
These orders ensure that inventory levels are accurately maintained and reflect the real-time needs of both customers (for sales) and suppliers (for purchases).

> # Procurement Workflow Example:
Purchase Requisition (PR) is created internally for needed goods or services.
RFQs are sent out to multiple suppliers for price quotes.
POs are issued to suppliers based on the accepted RFQ.
Supplier delivers goods, and Supplier Invoice is received.
The invoice is verified against the PO and goods receipt, and payment is processed.
